## Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly set up the Flexiti Studio Fullstops Next.js App Template and keep it up to date.

### 1. Create your project with Degit

Use `degit` to clone the template without git history:

```bash
npx degit nicxd531/fullstack-next-template my-project
cd my-project
2. Install dependencies

npm install
3. Update dependencies to latest versions
Before running, it’s a good idea to update all packages to their latest compatible versions:


npm update
For major version upgrades, consider using a tool like npm-check-updates:


npm install -g npm-check-updates
ncu -u
npm install
4. Run the development server

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 to view your app.

5. Start building!
Now you can customize and build your app on top of this solid template.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
